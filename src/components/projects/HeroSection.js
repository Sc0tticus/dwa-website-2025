            This year, we successfully conducted impactful women empowerment, advocacy, and health awareness programs reaching over 5,000 women across 28 villages. 
            These initiatives have strengthened womenâ€™s voices, improved health practices, and created pathways for self-reliance and dignity within their communities. 
            Our work has been made possible through the generous support of our major funding partners, including MEI USA, BASAID, and UCH, 
            whose commitment has enabled us to expand our reach.
