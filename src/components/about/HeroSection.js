          Dalit Welfare Association is a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering marginalized communities
          in the rural villages of Nandyal and Kurnool districts. 
          Our work focuses on uplifting Dalit women through micro-credit, financial literacy, and sustainable livelihood opportunities.
          By strengthening womenâ€™s capacity to lead and support their families, we strive to break poverty cycles, foster equality, and
          build resilient, inclusive communities for future generations.
